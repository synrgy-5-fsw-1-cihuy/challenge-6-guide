# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In the context of a web application, this usually means verifying the user's credentials, such as a username and password. Authentication is usually done by a server, which will respond with a token that can be used to identify the user in subsequent requests. The token is usually stored in the browser's local storage, and is sent to the server in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests. The server will then verify the token and respond with the appropriate data.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The user sends a request to the server with their credentials.
2. The server verifies the credentials and responds with a token.
3. The user stores the token in the browser's local storage.
4. The user sends a request to the server with the token in the `Authorization` header.
5. The server verifies the token and responds with the appropriate data.
